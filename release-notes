Edit comments.
New comment style.

  No more colloborative wiki-like discussion, just comments.
  In the feature versions we may add "colloborative wiki" option,
  to make any post accessible in multi-user edit mode.

Features added:
  Edit paper info is now possible!
  It is also possible to delete the paper.

Bugs fixed:
  a. You can upload a .PDF paper now, not only .pdf.
  b. Fix [Reply] button behavior
