Big Changes:
  no more colloborative wiki-like discussion, just comments.
  In the feature versions we may add "colloborative wiki" option,
  to make any post accessible to multi-user edit.

Features added:
  edit papers info
  edit comments

Bugs fixed:
  a. You can upload a .PDF paper now, not only .pdf.
  b. Fix [Reply] button behavior.

 
Henceforth, Max is a moderator
